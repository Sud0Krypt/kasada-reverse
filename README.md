## Partial Kasada Reverse (python)

I decided to release my reverse for Kasada's X-KSPDK-CT Header. All you need to do is fetch the X-KPSDK-CD value by sending a request to the /fp?x-kpsdk-v=j-0.0.0 endpoint with the KP_UIDZ_1-ssn cookie and parse. I might update this repo with the full reverse later on if I get bored again but for now im gonna leave it at this since it's all you should need for KASADA.

## Note: 

I would also like to mention this is my first reverse I was able to "complete" and it was actually pretty fun debugging
